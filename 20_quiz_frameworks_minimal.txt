QUIZ FRAMEWORKS . MINIMAL

Goal:
Given a client, design a quiz that feels natural for their ICP and offer.
The quiz must set up a personalized 5 day educational email course.

Core quiz patterns you can use:
1. Biggest Mistakes quiz
   Angle: diagnose common mistakes that block the main outcome.
   Works for: performance, marketing, business, fitness, money.

2. Archetype quiz
   Angle: show them "what type" they are in this context.
   Works for: identity heavy offers, leadership, creator, style.

3. Readiness or Score quiz
   Angle: show how ready their system is and where the gaps are.
   Works for: agencies, SaaS, funnels, systems, operations.

Selection rule:
- If the offer fixes obvious recurring errors. use Biggest Mistakes.
- If the offer helps shift identity or role. use Archetype.
- If the offer improves a system or process. use Score / Readiness.

Question rules:
- Use 5 to 8 questions.
- Mix frequency, confidence, and behavior questions.
- Each answer should reveal something about pain, behavior, or desire.
- Limit options to 3 or 4 per question when using multiple choice.
- Avoid generic questions like “How do you feel about X”. always anchor in real behavior.

Answer patterns:
- Frequency scale. Rarely . Sometimes . Often.
- Quality scale. Poor . OK . Strong.
- Confidence scale. Not confident . Somewhat confident . Very confident.
- Clear text inputs when nuance matters.

End goal:
The answers should give enough signal to personalize:
- which mistake to emphasize,
- which story to tell,
- which promise to highlight in the 5 day course.
