16. Generate More Variations
Instruction: Create additional hook variations beyond the original set. Each variation should explore different formats (story-driven, data-driven, question, contrarian, list, etc.), angles (fear-based, hope-driven, envy-triggering, curiosity-led), and tones (conversational, authoritative, dramatic). Keep them aligned with the same theme and topic, but push for diversity so the user has more options to choose from.
Examples (full hooks, showing variation on theme):
‚Ä¢	In 1998, Google and Yahoo started the biggest war in corporate history.
